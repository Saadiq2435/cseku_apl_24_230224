# Restaurant Management System

## Overview

The **Restaurant Management System** is a Java-based application designed to manage various aspects of a restaurant, including menus, orders, customers, employees, and payments. It employs the **MVC (Model-View-Controller)** architectural pattern to ensure the system is modular, scalable, and maintainable.

This project streamlines the management of restaurant operations by organizing and representing information such as menu items, orders, customer details, employee roles, and payment processing in a structured and user-friendly manner.

## Features

- **Menu Management**: Manage a restaurant’s menu, including adding, updating, and listing menu items.
- **Order Management**: Track orders, calculate total amounts, and associate orders with customers.
- **Customer Management**: Store customer details such as name and contact information.
- **Employee Management**: Manage restaurant staff, including chefs and waiters, and track their responsibilities.
- **Payment Management**: Handle payment processing with multiple payment methods, including cash and card.
- **Seamless Integration**: Ensure interaction between various components such as menus, orders, and employees.

## Project Structure

The project follows the **MVC (Model-View-Controller)** design pattern, ensuring a clear separation of concerns. Here’s a breakdown of the project structure:

## MVC Architecture

The **Restaurant Management System** strictly adheres to the **MVC (Model-View-Controller)** pattern. Here’s how the pattern has been implemented:

### 1. **Model Layer (Data Layer)**

The **Model** represents the data and business logic of the application. It handles all the information related to menus, orders, customers, employees, and payments.

- **Models**: Classes like `Menu`, `Order`, `Customer`, `Employee`, and `Payment` are responsible for holding and manipulating the data for their respective entities.
- **Business Logic**: The core business logic (e.g., calculating the total amount for orders, assigning employees to tasks) resides in the model classes.

### 2. **View Layer (Presentation Layer)**

The **View** is responsible for displaying information to the user and receiving input. It provides the user interface for the system.

- **Views**: The `RestaurantView` class renders the restaurant’s menus, orders, and other details in a readable format.

### 3. **Controller Layer (Interaction Layer)**

The **Controller** acts as the intermediary between the **Model** and the **View**. It listens to user input from the view, processes it (if necessary), updates the model, and refreshes the view to reflect any changes.

## Running the Project

To run the project:

1. Compile the Java files.
2. Execute the `Main` class located in the `restaurant.main` package.

You will be able to interact with the system, including viewing menus, placing orders, managing employees, and processing payments.

## Dependencies

- **Java 11 or higher**
- **Maven or Gradle** for dependency management (if required)

---

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates the implementation of the **MVC** design pattern to manage restaurant operations. By adhering to **MVC**, the system ensures **modularity**, **scalability**, and **maintainability**, making it easier to expand and maintain over time.
